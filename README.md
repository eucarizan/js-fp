## learnings 
this project will introduce you to hyperskill projects. practice javascript coding to build a program that can automate your account management routine.

## about
imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. you are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.

## stages
### 1: print the prices
<details>
<summary>start with printing the names of items and their prices using your first javascript function.</summary>

#### 1.1 description
you've recently opened a new corner shop. it is relatively small; it contains only a bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, milk chocolate, doughnuts, and pancakes.

the first version of the program will display a list of all the products with their prices.

#### 1.2 objectives
- print the `prices`: line;
- print the item names and prices from the example below. your output format should follow it.
- use `console.log()` to get the desired output. 

#### 1.3 example
**example 1**: *output at the end of this stage*
```
prices:
bubblegum: $2
toffee: $0.2
ice cream: $5
milk chocolate: $4
doughnut: $2.5
pancake: $3.2
```

</details>

### 2: measure the total income of your shop 
<details>
<summary>you know how much you earned by selling each item. calculate the total earnings before staff and other expenses!</summary>

#### 2.1 description
a month has passed since the opening of your shop. let's calculate the total earnings for this period! you know the total earned amount for each item:

item name|earned amount
:-:|:-:
`bubblegum`|`$202`
`toffee`|`$118`
`ice cream`|`$2250`
`milk chocolate`|`$1680`
`doughnut`|`$1075`
`pancake`|`$80`

**use the above data to find the total income for the first month and log the results as shown below.**

#### 2.2 objectives
in this stage, your program should:
- print the `earned amount`: line.
- print the item names and the earned amount for each of them;
- print the total earnings as shown below. replace `0.0` with the actual total sum:

```
income: $0.0
```

#### 2.3 examples
**example 1**: _output at the ned of this stage would look like below **(figures may vary)**_
```
earned amount:
bubblegum: $202
toffee: $118
ice cream: $2250
milk chocolate: $1680
doughnut: $1075
pancake: $80

income: $7777.0
```
